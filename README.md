# WalkTheDog

This is my final project for my C# & .NET course. This is a simple desktop application to track time spent walking dogs. There are 3 parts to the application that demonstrate the ability to design and instantiate classes, basic GUI knowledge, and use of LINQ.

Part 1:
  Client information is entered into a form that instantiates an Account object and adds the object to an array of accounts.
  
Part 2:
  The application must have the ability to add walking time to specific dogs through the GUI.
  
Part 3:
  A report generating feature that displays total time spent walking all dogs, time spent walking a specific dog, etc.
